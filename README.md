ThematicMap
===========
A library for drawing thematic maps in [Processing](http://processing.org/). Undocumented, untested, and unfinished!

Features
--------

ThematicMap will make it easy to draw layers. For example, to draw a `Point` layer on a `Polygon` layer:

ThematicMap will make it easy to draw different layers into different graphics contexts. Consequently, it will be easy to add a filter, such as a blur, to a layer. Compare North America in the following two figures:

You might wish to use the amount of blur to represent the amount of uncertainty associated with the data.
